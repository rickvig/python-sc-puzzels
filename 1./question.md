Tell us about one thing you are proud of in your career. It could be a difficult technical problem you had to solve in your work or a personal project. There is no need to go into details; a short paragraph explaining the problem and why you are proud of it would be fine.

## The Answer

I'm proud of several moments in my career. Here are a few highlights:

1. I automated the process of reading monthly offer spreadsheets that were manually input into the system using the Apache POI library in Java. This automation reduced the workload from one week to just a few minutes.

2. I created the core of the data pipeline with features stored for connecting software products with machine learning models, delivering more simplified and maintained technology to both teams, developers, and data scientists. This encapsulated the project for enhanced maintainability and versatility in creating new data products based on the delivery of the core. I used the DBT tool to build it.

3. I developed a data squad model and led it for 2 years. The squad was composed of 2 data engineers, 2 data analysts, 1 software engineer, and 1 intern. During this period, I faced many challenges, but my greatest pride was being able to deliver real value to the clients.
